# Getting-Data-Course-Project

This script (run_analysis.R) takes the Samsung data and produces a tidy data set 
containing the average values each variable (restricted to the 
mean and standard deviation for each measurement per step 2 of 
the instructions) for each activity and each subject. This is
done in two steps: 

1. Create a tidy dataset combining the information from the various given files.
2. Present the desired average values in a second tidy data set.
