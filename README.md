This repository contains a script (run_analysis.R) which takes a certain [raw data set]("abcd")

## <a name="abcd"></a>The raw data 

## The analysis script

## The code book

This script (run_analysis.R) takes the Samsung data and produces a tidy data set containing the average values of each variable (restricted to the mean and standard deviation for each measurement per step 2 of the instructions) for each activity and each subject. This is done in two steps: 

1. Create a tidy dataset combining the information from the various given files.
2. Present the desired average values in a second tidy data set.
